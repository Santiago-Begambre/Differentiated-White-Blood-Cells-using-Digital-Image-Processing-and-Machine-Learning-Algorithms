# Differentiated-White-Blood-Cells-using-Digital-Image-Processing-and-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
#98 images from ten (10) volunteers were used for this study. These samples were taken with the Venoject system; with a vein blood extraction, smear, and Wright staining to visualize differentiated white cells. The images were preprocessed to highlight their main characteristics (nucleus morphology, plasma membrane definition, cell color, etc.). These characteristics were labeled using the Bag of Visual Words (BoVW) method and classified using the Ensemble Subspace K Nearest Neighbor (ESkNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) models. Finally, data training and evaluation was performed.
