# Differentiated-White-Blood-Cells-using-Digital-Image-Processing-and-Machine-Learning-Algorithms

Introduction

98 images from ten (10) volunteers were used for this study. These samples were taken with the Venoject system; with a vein blood extraction, smear, and Wright staining to visualize differentiated white cells. The images were preprocessed to highlight their main characteristics (nucleus morphology, plasma membrane definition, cell color, etc.). These characteristics were labeled using the Bag of Visual Words (BoVW) method and classified using the Ensemble Subspace K Nearest Neighbor (ESkNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) models. Finally, data training and evaluation was performed.

Data Description

A set of 98 color images were obtained from the samples using an optical microscope (Microscope-Zeiss Primo Star) with an achromatic lens at a 100 X magnification. These images were recorded using a digital camera adapted to the microscope (Model Leica No. DMC5400) and saved in a JPG format (720 Ã— 576 pixels). A bacteriologist identified the images and classified them into differentiated leukocytes: Basophils, Eosinophils, Lymphocytes, Monocytes, and Neutrophils. It is noted that the number of Basophils found in the images was very low, hence they were not employed in the analysis. The algorithm was executed on a computer with an AMD A-12-9720P RADEON R7 A 2.7 GHz processor and 12 GB RAM.
